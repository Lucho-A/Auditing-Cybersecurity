# Auditing-Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity framework developed in C, Ansi-style

***(Under development)*** Intended for auditing/security assessment, the program scan by using a TCP Stealth mode, the X top risk ports of a server (max. 5000) and, eventually, it carries out some hacking procedures (Banner, CERT grabbing, BFA, DoS, etc.) on opened ports by running own code (using, mainly, sockets, libSSH2, and libCurl) and/or the latest free third-parties ones (mainly, Fierce, nMap scripts, and Metasploit). 

The main idea of the program is provide a framework with the essentials commands/tools in order to ensure, by their use, a well-knowledge of the effectiveness and efficiency of the implemented controls, in order to evaluate the residual risk of the processes.
