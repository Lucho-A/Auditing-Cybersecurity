# TCP-Syn-Port-Scanner
TCP Syn Port Scanner developed in C, Ansi-style

***(Under development)*** Intended for auditing/security assessment and educational purposes, the program scan by using a TCP Stealth mode, the X top risk ports of a server (max. 5000) and, eventually ('--hack-opened-ports' argument), it tries to carry out some hacking procedures (Port and CERT grabbing, BFA, etc.). 

Example: sudo ./TCP\ Syn\ Port\ Scanner lucho-alfie.ddns.net 5000 --hack-opened-ports
