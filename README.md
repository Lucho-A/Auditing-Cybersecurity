# Auditing-Cybersecurity (aka Mr. Anderson)
Cybersecurity framework developed in C, Ansi-style

Intended for auditing/security assessment, the program scan by using a TCP Stealth mode, the X top risk ports of a server (max. 5000) or all ports, and, eventually, it carries out some hacking procedures (port banner grabbing, CERT grabbing, BFA, DoS, Metasploits, nMap scripts, etc.) on opened ports by running own code (using, mainly: sockets, libpcap, libnet, libSSH2, and libCurl, among others libraries) and/or the latest free third-party softwares (for instance: Dig, Nikto, Fierce, nMap, Metasploit, SQLMap, among others). 

The main objective of the program is provide a framework with the essentials commands/tools for ensuring, by their use, a well-knowledge of the effectiveness and efficiency of the implemented controls, in order to evaluate the residual risk of an assessment.

<!-- ### BTW
For those folks who ask me if I will release the source code: yes, I will. Two reasons stop me right now: in first place, I'm not fully comfortable with the code. I've been re-organizing it, I have a lot of ideas, etc.. In second place (first?), I've been looking for a job since 2 years ago, I've had more than 40 interviews, and I didn't getting hire!, so, Iâ€™m not sure why I should give my work to the society for free if this shameless society is incapable to give a job to me! hhahah... anyway, as I said: take me patience, I will ;)

### Installation/Updating
[Download](https://github.com/Lucho-A/Auditing-Cybersecurity/releases/latest) the file, and use apt-get for resolving dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install ./auditing-cybersecurity_X.X_X.deb
```
Note: if you already have installed the program, since v1.2.2, it's possible to perform the update executing:
```
auditing-cybersecurity --update
```
Optional (recommended) third-parties softwares:
```
sudo apt-get install nmap metasploit-framework sqlmap whatweb nikto fierce dnsenum traceroute whois
```
Then:
```
auditing-cybersecurity --help
```
Finally, I recommend you to edit the different brute force attack usernames & password files, HTTP grabbing files, etc. located into:
```
cd /usr/share/auditing-cybersecurity/resources/
```
