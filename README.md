# Auditing-Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity framework developed in C, Ansi-style

***(Under development)*** Intended for auditing/security assessment, the program scan by using a TCP Stealth mode, the X top risk ports of a server (max. 5000) and, eventually, it carries out some hacking procedures (Port banner grabbing, CERT grabbing, BFA, DoS, etc.) on opened ports by running own code (using, mainly: sockets, libSSH2, and libCurl) and/or the latest free third-party softwares (for instance: Dig, Nikto, Fierce, nMap scripts, and Metasploit). 

The main idea of the program is provide a framework with the essentials commands/tools in order to ensure, by their use, a well-knowledge of the effectiveness and efficiency of the implemented controls, in order to evaluate the residual risk of the assessment.
